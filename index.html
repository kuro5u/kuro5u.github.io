		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This is the official website for the cybersecurity team of Technical University of Crete - TUCsec. The main goals of the team are to bring new people to the cybersecurity space, participate in CTF competitions and learn cool stuff about computer systems and security.</p>

		<h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
		<p>CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of educational competition, where teams are challenged to solve problems across different fields of cybersecurity with the purpose of obtaining flags. A flag is a string hidden in a vulnerable system and indicates the solution of the problem, as well as the level of access a malicious actor would gain in a similar real case scenario. Here is a flag:</p>
		<p align="center"><b><i><marquee>TUC{n0w_u_kn0w_wh4t_1t_l00k5_l1k3}</marquee></i></b></p>

		<h2>What are the team's fields of interest?</h2>
		<p>Anything computer and security related really, but we try to focus on topics that are more common in CTF competitions. These include:</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<h3>Main categories</h3>
				<li><i>Web Exploitation (web)</i></li>
				<li><i>Reverse Engineering (rev)</i></li>
				<li><i>Forensics (foren)</i></li>
				<li><i>Cryptography (crypto)</i></li>
				<li><i>Binary Exploitation (pwn)</i></li>

				<h3>Secondary categories</h3>
				<li><i>Penetration Testing (fullpwn)</i></li>
				<li><i>Hardware (hardware)</i></li>
				<li><i>Blockchain (blockchain)</i></li>
				<li><i>Mobile (mobile)</i></li>
				<li><i>Cloud Security (cloud)</i></li>
				<li><i>Game Hacking (gamepwn)</i></li>
				<li><i>Open-Source Intelligence (osint)</i></li>
				<li><i>Miscellaneous (misc)</i></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>Each member of the team typically focuses on one or two of the above roles and has a different skill set. You don't have to learn everything, but we encourage a strong foundation in general knowledge.</p>

		<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
		<p>Anyone who is willing to learn and put in the time. We are here to help with anything you need, but the drive to learn and grow is on you. :)</p>
		
		<h2>I don't plan on following a career in cybersecurity. Why bother?</h2>
		<p>We believe everyone should have at least a basic understanding and awareness for computer security in today's digital age, regardless of their career path. This knowledge helps you protect yourself from potential threats and also provides valuable insights applicable in many areas. You can learn many useful things here no matter what you decide to do later on in your career.</p>

		<h2>I am a total n00b. Can I join anyway?</h2>
		<p>Everyone was at some point. That's what this team is for. There are no prerequisites for joining the team, but any skills you have might come in handy.</p>

		<h2>What plans do you have currently?</h2>
		<p>We are currently in the process of recruiting more people and organizing on-site workshops and competitions for our team members. We also participate in CTF competitions every other week. At this phase, we would like to expand the team to fill more roles and be able to play more competitively in CTFs.</p>
