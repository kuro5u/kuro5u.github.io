		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This is the official website for the cybersecurity team of Technical University of Crete ~ TUCsec. The main goals of the team are to bring new people to the cybersecurity space, participate in CTF competitions and learn cool stuff about computer systems and security.</p>

		<h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
		<p>CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of educational cybersecurity competition, where teams are challenged to solve problems across different fields of cybersecurity with the purpose of obtaining flags. A flag is a string hidden in a vulnerable system and indicates the solution of the problem as well as the level of access a malicious actor would gain in a similar real case scenario. Here is a flag:</p>
		<p align="center"><b><i>TUC{n0w_u_kn0w_wh4t_1t_l00k5_l1k3}</i></b></p>

		<h2>What areas do you focus on?</h2>
		<p>Anything computer and security related really. That being said there are some common topics that we generally see in CTF competitions and we try to focus more on. These include:</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<h3>Main categories</h3>
				<li><i>Web Exploitation (web)</i></li>
				<li><i>Reverse Engineering (rev)</i></li>
				<li><i>Forensics (foren)</i></li>
				<li><i>Cryptography (crypto)</i></li>
				<li><i>Binary Exploitation (pwn)</i></li>

				<h3>Secondary categories</h3>
				<li><i>Penetration Testing (fullpwn)</i></li>
				<li><i>Hardware (hardware)</i></li>
				<li><i>Blockchain (blockchain)</i></li>
				<li><i>Mobile (mobile)</i></li>
				<li><i>Cloud Security (cloud)</i></li>
				<li><i>Game Hacking (gamepwn)</i></li>
				<li><i>Open-Source Intelligence (osint)</i></li>
				<li><i>Miscellaneous (misc)</i></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
		<p>Anyone who is willing to learn and put in the time. We are here to help with anything you need, but we can't force you to learn and we can't learn you how to learn. That's on you. :)</p>
		
		<h2>I don't plan on following a career in cybersecurity. Why bother?</h2>
		<p>We believe that anyone should have at least a basic understanding and awareness for computer security in this day and age, no matter what they do. That way you can protect yourself better and also have a better perspective for lots of things. Security isn't only about computers after all. You can learn many useful things here no matter what you decide to do later on in your career.</p>

		<h2>I am a total n00b. Can I join anyway?</h2>
		<p>Everyone was at some point. That's what this team is for. There are no prerequisites for joining the team, but <b><i>any</i></b> skills you have might come in handy.</p>

		<h2>What plans do you have currently?</h2>
		<p>We are in the process of recruiting and organizing live workshops and competitions for our team members. We also participate in CTF competitions every other week. Ideally we would like to have more people to cover more roles in the team and be able to play more competitively in CTFs.</p>
